# Goals-For-Today
Capstone project preliminary scaffolding

Followed the steps here for React, Babel, and Webpack setup: https://www.valentinog.com/blog/babel/

Needed a combo of sources for the Sass setup, mostly these two: https://developerhandbook.com/webpack/how-to-configure-scss-modules-for-webpack/ and https://blog.marcnuri.com/react-babel-webpack-sass-application/ 

## To run locally

1. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/emreercelebi/Goals-For-Today.git`
2. navigate into directory and install packages with yarn: `cd Goals-For-Today && yarn`
3. start the webpack dev server: `yarn start`
4. open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ the app should be running!

As long as the webpack server is running, code changes should be reflected after saving. Try it out!

## To start the server locally

1. Clone the repo, `cd Goals-For-Today` and `yarn`.
2. `yarn build` to create the build files in the dist/ folder.
3. `yarn server-start` to start the local server
