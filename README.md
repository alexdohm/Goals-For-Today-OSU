# Goals-For-Today
To do :
- set up JSW token authentication in the back end ( need user id sent back to react )
- Integrate the redux / react part into the existing front end.

- All we care about is a user session for now, we need to make sure they are logged in and allowed to navigate the app
- Put a sign out button on home page to test functionality
## To start the server locally

1. Clone the repo, `cd Goals-For-Today` and `yarn`.
2. `yarn build-production` to create the build files in the dist/ folder.
3. `yarn server-start` to start the local server
